# MeaplannerServer - integrated with React app 

In 2021 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack bootcamp. In the second course, we created dynamic web applications with React, and in the last phase, we were taught how to develop a backend with NodeJS. 

This project was created as the backend of my MealPlanner React application.[Go to React repository.](https://github.com/madisonisfan/meaplanner-react-integration) Currently, the data provided by the server is a list of recipes.
